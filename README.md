# ‚ùì About AutoScene

AutoScene allows you to work on your scene setup in the editor while loading a specific scene when entering Play mode.

## Conventions

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) for its commit messages.

# üñ• Requirements

# üõ† How to Use AutoScene

Once installed, AutoScene appears as a new entry in your Unity Preferences, as displayed below.

AutoScene presents only two parameters: **Enable AutoScene** and **Scene to load on Play**. For the later, three modes are available:

- **Auto** (the default since version 1.2.2): the first scene in the project's Build Settings will be used. If no such scene exists (no scene in the project's Build Settings), AutoScene will fall back to **None**.
- **None** (the default _before_ version 1.2.2): no specific scene will be loaded and the normal behaviour of Unity when entering Play mode is maintained.
- Any further entry refers to a specific scene in the project. By selecting a scene, it will be loaded when entering Play mode.
