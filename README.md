Once installed, AutoScene appears as a new entry in your Unity Preferences, as displayed below.

AutoSceen presents only two parameters: **Enable AutoScene** and **Scene to load on Play**. For the later, three modes are available:

- By selecting **None** (the default), no specific scene will be loaded and the normal behaviour of Unity when entering Play mode is maintained.
- By selection **Auto**, the first scene in the project's Build Settings will be used. If no such scene exists (no scene in the project's Build Settings), AutoScene will fall back to **None**.
- Any further entry refers to a specific scene in the project. By selecting a scene, it will be loaded when entering Play mode.
